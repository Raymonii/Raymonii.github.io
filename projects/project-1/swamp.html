<h1>POV: You're greeted by Lord Farquaad.<img src="images/lordfarquaad.jpg" alt=""></h1>
<body>
    <p>"Good evening, please take your seats. We've got some good greens and I'm not just talking about Sir Shrek."</p>
</body>
<p>You're escorted into the small taver-like humble abode where you are served a silver dish that was definetly taken from the castle. There lies a DUCK!</p>
<p>You're flabberghasted.</p>
<p>"Eat up, Silly," Shrek says as he takes a bite.</p>
<p>You take a bite and you feel... relieved. </p>
<p>"Silly Goose," Shrek laughs. "You should've seen the look on you're face. Oh I'm gonna kick my feet up to this tonight."</p>
<p>"One thing about Ogres- many of us are VEGAN! It's a vegan duck cake."</p>
<p>It's true... Never judge an ogre by their color... unless you think of green which symbolizes sustainability.</p>
